# Busshade
An android app that calculates the best seat in a bus to get the least amount of sun while traveling.

## How it works
The app tracks your location, what datetime is it and where the sun is based on those informations. With this, the app can estimate when the sun will rise/set and its position on the sky on your location to calculate where the sun is facing relative to the bus. To track a whole trip, we divide the trip into segments and calculate in what time you'll be in each segment based on Google Maps info and then we calculate sun's position in that location.
